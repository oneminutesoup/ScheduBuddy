This is the webapp frontend developed for
[schedubuddy](https://schedubuddy.com/)
with
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
and
[Material-UI](https://next.material-ui.com/).
This webapp receives university schedules tailored to the user and displays them in a familiar format.
**For the back-end, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/Exanut/schedubuddy-server).**

### Usage
This webapp was designed to be lightweight and intuitive, but also powerful.
To try it out, simply select an academic term, enter courses from the autocomplete, tune your preferences, and press "Get Schedules".
After a few seconds of searching, the top schedules will be displayed in the order given by the ranking algorithm.
Every schedule will be unique-looking, so that a variety of schedules can be given.

There are also other features, such as viewing all the classes that occur in a given lecture room, or viewing the rooms that are open at a given time of day.
